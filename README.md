# Towards One-Shot Learning for Text Classification using Inductive Logic Programming
This repository presents the implementation and results of the paper "<a href=""> Towards One-Shot Learning for Text Classification using Inductive Logic Programming</a>",  presented at ICLP 2023. The study explores the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), particularly Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL), for one-shot text classification with the integration of commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet.

## Overview
The project demonstrates how to classify short text ("tasks") using minimal training data by:
- Leveraging Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) to generate human-readable classification rules.
- Integrating commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet.
- Comparing performance with Siamese Networks, a popular deep learning model for few-shot learning.

### Key Features
- **One-Shot Learning**: Learns from as few as one positive and one negative example.
- **Recursive Rule Learning**: Supports predicate invention and recursive hypotheses.
- **Commonsense Knowledge**: Uses ConceptNet to enrich background knowledge.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarks MIL against Aleph (traditional ILP) and Siamese Networks.
